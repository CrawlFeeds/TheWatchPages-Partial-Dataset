This timepiece from the collection boasts a sleek, glossy black dial, intentionally free of numerals and other elements, highlighting the exquisite black laqué piano finish and the overall allure of the watch. The dial is meticulously crafted with 20 layers of translucent lacquer and five layers of colored lacquer, creating a striking look that complements the polished case beautifully. One of the standout features of the Curvex CX Piano is its pear-shaped hands, which gracefully adorn the black laqué piano dial. This design choice not only adds to the watch’s aesthetic appeal but also ensures clear visibility of the time. The Curvex CX Piano is not just about its visual appeal; comfort is also a key consideration. The black satin strap is designed for ultimate wrist comfort while also enhancing the watch’s sophisticated look with its black laqué piano finish. The design of the Curvex CX Piano includes a perfectly curved case with unique contours, offering excellent dial visibility and minimizing material on the sides. The internal bezel, distinct from the case and set beneath the sapphire glass, allows for stunning two-tone effects. The Curvex CX collection has grown to include new sizes of 30 and 33 millimeters, with case options of yellow gold, rose gold, stainless steel, or black steel. The Piano collection is defined by its refined, clean aesthetic, making it a timeless choice that brings an element of sophistication and style to any ensemble.",0fd08b73-b716-56a8-b31c-04f27190beaf,21/10/2024 17:09:12

This design ensures a visually harmonious and structured aesthetic. The watch has a strong identity with a sporty essence, featuring a refined design complemented by a rubber strap that seamlessly conforms to the case shape. The strap offers exceptional comfort, elasticity, and resistance to extreme temperature variations ranging from -30°C to +70°C. To achieve a thinner case, the watch dial comprises three superimposed layers, with the first layer replacing the traditional spacer ring, a feature protected by patent no. 102021000031718. The caseback design reflects the complexity of the watch’s engineering, using a combination of screws, grooves, and three different finishes: radial satin, micro-sandblasting, and polishing. The overall design of the Nereide Ultraleggero not only emphasizes its technical sophistication but also ensures maximum comfort and durability from the first use.",6b651343-f2d4-5fd0-9139-09f30e9e01bd,21/10/2024 17:09:13

Sergei Krikalev, a legendary figure in the realm of space exploration, stands as a beacon of achievement among cosmonauts. With an impressive tally of six space missions and an astounding 803 days spent in space, equivalent to nearly 2.5 years, Krikalev has rightfully earned the nickname “Record Man” in Russia. His remarkable experience makes him the ultimate authority on the watch requirements of cosmonauts. In the challenging environment of space, cosmonauts demand watches that are both simple and robust, capable of withstanding the extreme conditions they face. Moreover, they require a specific feature – a 24-hour movement – to distinguish day from night within the International Space Station (ISS), where they encounter 16 sunrises and sunsets every 24 hours due to the ISS orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes. Addressing these needs, Raketa introduced the Raketa “Baikonur” watch, a resilient 24-hour automatic timepiece. This watch houses the Raketa automatic movement, meticulously crafted at the Raketa Watch Factory in Saint-Petersburg. Its open case back reveals a captivating celestial design featuring a cosmonaut soaring among constellations. Furthermore, the Raketa “Baikonur” proudly displays the iconic words uttered by Gagarin during his historic space flight in Russian, which translates to “Let’s go!” in English. The Raketa “Baikonur” 0247 watch embodies the essence of precision and durability required by cosmonauts like Sergei Krikalev during their missions. With its 24-hour movement and exquisite craftsmanship, it meets and exceeds the demands of space exploration.",c6e67fc6-7486-5fa4-a3ba-2934ebbb8d53,21/10/2024 17:09:15

This verison features a dial color reminiscent of desert sand, symbolizing adventure and nature. Limited to only 60 pieces, the watch includes handcrafted dial finishes and a complex case design. The “Ripples Dune date” is powered by the SMA03-TD calibre, designed and built by Speake Marin’s atelier in La Chaux-de-Fonds.

This unique timepiece draws its essence from the circular slide rule, an instrumental tool in mathematical calculations. It has been around since its inception in the 17th century and was notably used by aircraft pilots in the 1930s for complex navigational calculations. This inspiration is vividly reflected in the watch’s design, particularly in its time display mechanism. Innovatively, the KLOK 01 deviates from traditional watch designs by using three coplanar graduated discs. These discs represent hours, minutes, and seconds, all situated on the same horizontal plane and moving counter-clockwise. Time is read along the vertical axis at the top of the dial, offering a graphical, intuitive view of time. This design is a nod to the mathematical calculation tools, marrying simplicity with utility. A notable feature of the Klokers KLOK 01 Heritage is its interchangeability, facilitated by the patented Klokers key. This system allows the wearer to easily detach the watch case from its strap, offering the flexibility to change straps according to mood and style. This feature transforms the Klokers watch into an adaptable accessory, suitable for any occasion. The KLOK 01 Heritage is available in multiple color options, ensuring that there is a style to suit every preference. Its compatibility with a wide range of straps and interchangeable accessories further enhances its appeal. Klokers, established in 2014, is celebrated for its revolutionary approach to watch design, characterized by an anti-clockwise movement and clockwise numerals—a bold deviation from traditional watchmaking conventions. The brand’s debut watch, the KLOK-01, features a design inspired by the circular slide rule, showcasing a retro-futuristic design and a unique, easy strap-fixing system. This model not only signaled Klokers’ entry into the watch industry but also illustrated its commitment to innovation and challenging the status quo. Klokers has established a distinctive and influential presence in the contemporary watchmaking landscape by reimagining traditional concepts and continuously innovating. As an authorized retailer of Klokers watches, we guarantee the authenticity of our timepieces, sourced directly from the manufacturer and come with a full two-year manufacturer’s warranty. Their unique designs and commitment to innovation make Klokers a compelling choice for those seeking a distinctive and reliable timepiece. Klokers watches are shipped with DHL international shipping.

Founded by Daniel Niederer and Arnaud Duval, the brand didn’t aim to blend in with the classic Swiss luxury watchmakers; instead, it set out to do something completely different. Forget sleek, minimalist dials and delicate hands—SevenFriday watches are all about industrial vibes, oversized cases, and cool, layered dials that show off their inner workings. Inspired by everything from machinery to architecture, SevenFriday watches have a distinct look that’s impossible to miss. They play with materials like stainless steel, wood, and leather, giving each watch a unique and tactile feel. And while the brand comes out of Switzerland, its pricing is surprisingly approachable, making it a favorite for people who want something stylish and distinctive without breaking the bank.",07ad9463-ca98-5042-9333-0765e40723b8,21/10/2024 17:09:20

This release showcases the pioneering Ti-CeramitechTM material, the result of seven years of development at Panerai’s Laboratorio di Idee in Neuchâtel. Inspired by the high-performance world of competitive sailing, this material, with its ceramic-coated surfaces, significantly reduces friction, enhancing efficiency and speed in racing boats. The Ti-CeramitechTM case is 44% lighter than steel yet remarkably tough, owing to a patented titanium ceramization process that yields a striking blue hue reminiscent of the open seas. The watches house the reliable automatic P.900 caliber with a 3-day power reserve, known for its precision and streamlined proportions. The bezel, also ceramized titanium, features a unique contrast of materials, further accentuated by bespoke-colored straps. Water resistant up to 500 meters, these watches undergo rigorous testing to exceed Panerai’s stringent standards. PAM01466 features a blue sun-brushed dial, while PAM01543 boasts a white-matt grained dial, both adorned with Luna Rossa decals and red second hands. Legibility is ensured with luminous hands and hour markers, while the general color palette evokes the ocean’s depths at twilight. Set to debut in July 2024, these timepieces strengthen the partnership between Panerai and Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, emphasizing Panerai’s commitment to innovative watches for aquatic adventures. PAM01466 will be available across all networks, while PAM01543 will be exclusive to boutiques, reflecting the brand’s dedication to craftsmanship and excellence.",4bef0985-d5e0-57d4-aee8-59300875c88c,21/10/2024 17:09:23

Aptly named the Tangente 38 date – 175 Years Watchmaking Glashütte collection, each of these limited-edition timepieces pays homage to the brand’s 175-year legacy with a unique burst of color, limited to just 175 pieces per version. Embracing the notion that color symbolizes individuality and vitality, NOMOS takes a daring step by transforming its iconic Tangente into a kaleidoscope of expressions. Yet, despite the departure from its traditional look, the essence of the Tangente remains intact, affirming its status as a cornerstone of the Nomos collections. With whimsical German monikers like Ariel, Zirkus, Haifischgrau, and Schlossgrün, each watch in this special edition tells its own distinct story. Breaking the mold, NOMOS makes these exclusive timepieces more accessible by offering them at a price lower than that of the standard model, thus democratizing the joy of mechanical watches. This commitment to inclusivity underscores the brand’s belief that fine watchmaking should be enjoyed by all, fostering a sense of diversity and individuality within the watchmaking world, and ensuring that everyone can partake in this celebration of Glashütte watchmaking. At the heart of the Tangente 38 date beats the hand-wound caliber DUW 4101, made in Glashütte and fitted with NOMOS’s proprietary swing system. Notably, NOMOS’s innovative date mechanism, seamlessly integrated into the movement, ensures a strikingly large date window positioned at the dial’s periphery—an unmistakable hallmark of the brand.",3b09d2c8-46f9-5f16-bc98-fa125398f7e9,21/10/2024 17:09:30

Aptly named the Tangente 38 date – 175 Years Watchmaking Glashütte collection, each of these limited-edition timepieces pays homage to the brand’s 175-year legacy with a unique burst of color, limited to just 175 pieces per version. Embracing the notion that color symbolizes individuality and vitality, NOMOS takes a daring step by transforming its iconic Tangente into a kaleidoscope of expressions. Yet, despite the departure from its traditional look, the essence of the Tangente remains intact, affirming its status as a cornerstone of the Nomos collections. With whimsical German monikers like Ariel, Zirkus, Haifischgrau, and Schlossgrün, each watch in this special edition tells its own distinct story. Breaking the mold, NOMOS makes these exclusive timepieces more accessible by offering them at a price lower than that of the standard model, thus democratizing the joy of mechanical watches. This commitment to inclusivity underscores the brand’s belief that fine watchmaking should be enjoyed by all, fostering a sense of diversity and individuality within the watchmaking world, and ensuring that everyone can partake in this celebration of Glashütte watchmaking. At the heart of the Tangente 38 date beats the hand-wound caliber DUW 4101, made in Glashütte and fitted with NOMOS’s proprietary swing system.

It maintains the field watch and vintage look while the white dial brings a more subdued feel. The dial design stays authentically true, but the clean white base with faux-patina contoured black indexes offers a unique experience compared to other versions. The distinctive minute and hour indexes are a nod to an era when these watches were hand-painted. Additionally, the triple-printed hour indexes emulate the irregularities left by a traditional 1940s paintbrush. With such a creative dial, the case anchors the watch in its 1940s A-11 Mil-Spec roots. The case is available in either a 32mm or in a 40mm size. The main case body is sandblasted to eliminate any gloss, in true field watch fashion. However, as a nod to the original shiny chrome plating found on most A-11s, the lugs are polished. The Brown Leather strap enhances the field watch look, tying the watch together as an elegant interpretation of what a field watch should be. It is suitable for both rugged environments and situations requiring a touch of elegance. Praesidus Watch Co. is a watchmaking brand inspired by World War II’s robust and functional military timepieces. Founded in the 21st century by watch enthusiasts and history buffs, Praesidus combines vintage designs with modern engineering. The name “Praesidus,” meaning “guardian” in Latin, reflects the brand’s commitment to reliability and precision. Their mission is to create watches that honor the past while meeting modern needs, offering both functionality and style. Praesidus watches use high-quality materials like stainless steel, sapphire crystal, and Swiss or Japanese movements. The designs often feature large, easy-to-read dials and luminous hands reminiscent of vintage military watches. Depending on the destination, the estimated delivery time for Praesidus watches ranges from 5 to 14 business days. Please be aware that customs procedures may affect these timeframes, and the estimated delivery period does not include the time needed for customs clearance. Outside of the United States, shipments may be subject to import duties once they reach your country.

As of 2024, watch diameters are trending smaller, and Nivada Grenchen’s answer to the ideal size is that of the original era. The brand emphasizes reissues that respect vintage dimensions and designs, maintaining unmatched authenticity. The 35mm size is making a strong comeback, appealing to both nostalgia buffs and neo-vintage enthusiasts. Powered by the manually wound Landeron 21 caliber, the Super Antarctic explores new possibilities in finesse with a 7mm case thickness (10.1mm including the crystal) and a 35mm diameter. Nivada Grenchen champions the understated and bold looks of smaller watches, countering the craze for larger sizes and prices and returning to an authentic size that fits all. The black dial is a true highlight. It features indexes filled with white or cream Super-LumiNova®, branded ‘Nivada Aquamatic’ below the 12 and ‘Super Antarctic 18 Rubis’ above the 6. The classic steel hands are filled with luminescence, and the iconic back is embossed with a stylized penguin on a gold medallion, just like the original piece.

Founded by Daniel Niederer and Arnaud Duval, the brand didn’t aim to blend in with the classic Swiss luxury watchmakers; instead, it set out to do something completely different. Forget sleek, minimalist dials and delicate hands—SevenFriday watches are all about industrial vibes, oversized cases, and cool, layered dials that show off their inner workings. Inspired by everything from machinery to architecture, SevenFriday watches have a distinct look that’s impossible to miss. They play with materials like stainless steel, wood, and leather, giving each watch a unique and tactile feel. And while the brand comes out of Switzerland, its pricing is surprisingly approachable, making it a favorite for people who want something stylish and distinctive without breaking the bank. Your SevenFriday order is shipped free of charge with DHL or FedEx. Once your order has been processed and prepared for shipment, you will receive an order confirmation.

The Raketa Polar watch draws inspiration from the iconic 1970 Raketa model, custom-crafted for Soviet polar explorers enduring the harshest Antarctic conditions. Its distinctive feature is the dial divided into 24 hours, ensuring precise timekeeping even beyond the polar circle, where the line between day and night blurs. This updated model elevates its capabilities with enhanced durability, featuring scratch-resistant sapphire glass that safeguards the dial. Thanks to the luminous paint applied to both hands and markers, it ensures impeccable time readability in the dark polar winters. Additionally, the watch boasts impressive pressure resistance, capable of withstanding up to 20 ATM, equivalent to enduring pressures found 200 meters underwater. Engineered by Russian experts at the Raketa Watch Factory, this model boasts an automatic movement crafted entirely in Saint Petersburg. The movement’s decor mirrors the captivating polar lights in the northern sky. Moreover, the Raketa “Polar” 0241 watch is officially certified by the Russian Federal Agency for Technical Regulation & Metrology, meeting stringent standards for survival in the unforgiving polar environment. Each watch comes with its own individual certificate, attesting to its quality and endurance.

Inspired by the original USN BUSHIPS design, this rugged dive watch stands out with its oversized crown and durable steel case. During WWII, Underwater Demolition Teams relied on this design as the only reliable way to ensure their watches remained water-resistant on prolonged missions. Praesidus has introduced a fresh take on the classic black dial with a striking shaded blue dial, going from a dark blue to a lighter blue. The standard white indices have been updated to a light blue, which is luminous for visibility, giving the watch a unique and contemporary flair. The A-5UDT Abyss Blue comes with a blue tropic rubber strap that features a vintage criss-cross texture for extra comfort on the wrist and perforated holes for breathability. It dries instantly and is resistant to all types of liquids, maintaining the rugged vintage look while enhancing comfort. Or with a choice of a stainless steel beads of rice bracelet. Praesidus Watch Co. is a watchmaking brand inspired by World War II’s robust and functional military timepieces. Founded in the 21st century by watch enthusiasts and history buffs, Praesidus combines vintage designs with modern engineering. The name “Praesidus,” meaning “guardian” in Latin, reflects the brand’s commitment to reliability and precision. Their mission is to create watches that honor the past while meeting modern needs, offering both functionality and style. Praesidus watches use high-quality materials like stainless steel, sapphire crystal, and Swiss or Japanese movements. The designs often feature large, easy-to-read dials and luminous hands reminiscent of vintage military watches.

Originally meant for women, its appeal soon grew, attracting male audiences and resulting in a true unisex offering. This timepiece stands out in the market of mid-size mechanical watches due to its robust, traditionally masculine features presented in sizes that typically don’t showcase such intricate designs. Available in 37mm and 40mm, the DAY41 caters to diverse preferences, offering five color options for the smaller size and three for the larger one. Each model is water-resistant up to 100 meters, blending functionality with style. At the core of the watch is the STP6-15 movement, a testament to precision and performance. Equipped with 26 jewels and operating at a 4Hz frequency, it ensures a smooth seconds hand sweep and boasts a 44-hour power reserve with automatic winding. Rigorous testing in five different positions guarantees the movement’s accuracy, maintaining a performance range of -0/+15 seconds per day. At the core of CODE41 is the principle of Total Transparency on Origin (TTO). They believe in revealing the precise origins of their watch components to their customers, maintaining an unwavering commitment to quality and aesthetics. Each DAY41 watch comes with a two-year international warranty, backed by a promise of efficient and prompt resolution of any technical issues. The DAY41 by CODE41 is a symbol of innovation, inclusivity, and precision. Its unique journey from a women-focused design to a unisex marvel, coupled with its mechanical excellence and commitment to customer satisfaction, makes it a standout choice.",2241fddb-2cc1-543a-ae4c-04063619f559,21/10/2024 17:09:45

Known for its simplicity and legibility, the A-11 was the first military watch to feature a sweep second hand and was produced by Elgin, Waltham, and Bulova. This reliable timepiece served US soldiers across both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters during World War II. The updated A-11 Service Watch maintains the original’s legacy of dependability and precision while incorporating modern enhancements for improved accuracy and comfort. The white dial, with its luminous indexes, ensures clear readability even in low-light conditions. The watch is powered by the robust TMI NH35 Automatic Movement, offering a balance of affordability and long-lasting reliability. Available in both 38mm and 42mm case sizes, it guarantees comfort and ease of reading. Assembled in the USA, this watch comes with a brown leather strap, embodying the spirit of the 1940s military specifications. Praesidus Watch Co. is a watchmaking brand inspired by World War II’s robust and functional military timepieces. Founded in the 21st century by watch enthusiasts and history buffs, Praesidus combines vintage designs with modern engineering. The name “Praesidus,” meaning “guardian” in Latin, reflects the brand’s commitment to reliability and precision. Their mission is to create watches that honor the past while meeting modern needs, offering both functionality and style. Praesidus watches use high-quality materials like stainless steel, sapphire crystal, and Swiss or Japanese movements. The designs often feature large, easy-to-read dials and luminous hands reminiscent of vintage military watches. Depending on the destination, the estimated delivery time for Praesidus watches ranges from 5 to 14 business days. Please be aware that customs procedures may affect these timeframes, and the estimated delivery period does not include the time needed for customs clearance. Outside of the United States, shipments may be subject to import duties once they reach your country. We do not control or assume responsibility for these additional charges; customers are responsible for customs clearance fees.

Housed in an 18K pink gold case, this limited edition of just five pieces draws inspiration from the mythical power of the dragon. At the heart of this masterpiece is the Calibre 945, a movement first introduced in 2010 that showcases Jaeger-LeCoultre’s unparalleled expertise in celestial complications. It features a Cosmotourbillon, a celestial vault, and a zodiacal calendar, all brought to life on a dial that maps the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky. Surrounding this celestial display are two engraved gold dragons, their detailed forms evoking the immense power of the cosmos as they orbit the dial. The multi-layered dial creates a sense of depth, drawing the eye to the cosmic elements while also serving as a canvas for Jaeger-LeCoultre’s artistic expression. With its display of sidereal time and an innovative minute repeater, the Master Hybris Artistica Calibre 945 ‘Dragon’ is a perfect fusion of tradition and modernity, offering a poetic connection between the wearer and the universe.",31ab9b0d-2825-5d5f-82ad-126758a763cc,21/10/2024 17:09:48

With a design that includes intricate details and cultural symbolism, the watch pays homage to the dragon as a symbol of power, prosperity, and good fortune in Chinese culture. The BR 05 Artline Dragon’s design is influenced by tattoo art, using light and shadow in its engravings to resemble a metal tattoo. The design includes natural elements and cultural references like the sun, moon, and swallows. The dragon motif is a fusion of various animals in mythology. This timepiece showcases the art of engraving, a millennial practice in China, as a tribute to Chinese culture and engraving art. The watch is crafted using a precise laser engraving technique, particularly challenging for the individually engraved bracelet links. Despite its artistic flair, the watch maintains the signature design elements of the BR 05 collection, like the rounded bezel and screw-attached case. It features the BR-CAL.321 self-winding mechanical movement, ensuring precision and practicality for an active lifestyle.

Drawing from a time when Cuba was known for elegance and allure, this ladies’ timepiece encapsulates that very essence with its intricate and captivating details. Inspired by Cuba’s rich history and the nation’s appeal during the 1930s, this collection stands out with its undeniable femininity. Each Historiador Primera Dama watch in this collection features a luminous mother-of-pearl dial, available in a host of striking colors. These dials are set with either 3 or 12 shimmering diamonds. The leaf-shaped hour and minute hands are not only elegant but also ensure easy readability. The Historiador Primera Dama is housed in a 36mm case, with verisons available in stainless steel or a rich golden PVD coating. Some models in this collection have a bezel set with 58 diamonds. The caseback is a tribute to the 1930s, showcasing a beautifully engraved image of an elegant lady of that era. For the strap, you have the choice of a glossy Louisiana alligator strap or a perfectly matched bracelet. The Historiador Primera Dama is the CyS 1005 quartz movement, ensuring precision and reliability, eliminating the need for winding. Cuervo y Sobrinos has a rich history dating back to 1862 when Spanish immigrant Ramón Fernández Cuervo opened a jewelry and watch repair shop in Havana, Cuba. In 1882, the business expanded with the incorporation of Cuervo’s nephews, officially becoming Cuervo y Sobrinos. The company thrived during Cuba’s golden age in the 1950s, with its prestigious boutique in Havana frequented by distinguished figures like Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, and Ernest Hemingway. Today, Cuervo y Sobrinos is located in Switzerland, but despite this, it has remained true to its Latin roots, drawing inspiration from its Cuban heritage for its watch designs and collections. Cuervo y Sobrinos has withstood the test of time, blending Swiss watchmaking expertise with Cuban flair, earning them a loyal following among watch enthusiasts.

Each model is water-resistant up to 100 meters, blending functionality with style. At the core of the watch is the STP6-15 movement, a testament to precision and performance. Equipped with 26 jewels and operating at a 4Hz frequency, it ensures a smooth seconds hand sweep and boasts a 44-hour power reserve with automatic winding. Rigorous testing in five different positions guarantees the movement’s accuracy, maintaining a performance range of -0/+15 seconds per day. At the core of CODE41 is the principle of Total Transparency on Origin (TTO).

This limited edition watch (only 250 pieces available) is built for adventure and designed with a safari-green dial, topped by a 2.5-mm thick, anti-reflective sapphire crystal. The watch is constructed with lightweight, durable titanium, features a soft rubber strap, and is pressure-tested to withstand 30 atmospheres. Equipped with Super-LumiNova-coated hands and markers, it ensures readability even in low light. The chronograph is powered by the reliable Calibre T310 movement, offering a 62-hour power reserve and automatic winding. In addition to its robust design, the Mara Safari Chronograph reflects the brand’s dedication to conservation. Derived from the Latin word tutus (meaning secure), Tutima is committed to protecting our global heritage. A portion of proceeds from each Mara Safari watch goes towards the Mara Elephant Project, which trains rangers, gathers data on elephant populations, and combats poaching. Inspired by the Goss family, whose history is intertwined with elephant conservation, Tutima’s partnership with the project reflects a deep commitment to safeguarding elephants and their habitats.",99b17060-1fe7-5345-9e32-327e24d00c5c,21/10/2024 17:09:54

Originally released in the 1950s, it pays tribute to the Golden Age of vinyl music. This watch offers affordability and style for both men and women. Delbana, founded in 1931 in Switzerland, combines Swiss craft with Italian style. The brand transitioned to quartz movements while maintaining design excellence. In the 1950s and 1960s, Delbana’s mechanical watches were popular, coinciding with the rise of vinyl records. The Recordmaster features a beige microgroove dial reminiscent of vinyl records, with retro-style indices and a beige guilloche center. It boasts mint green luminous hands and a red seconds hand. The 40mm stainless steel case is versatile, and the watch is powered by the reliable Sellita SW200 automatic movement, visible through the exhibition caseback. Delbana, founded by Goliardo Della Balda in 1931 in Bienne, Switzerland, prides themselves on manufacturing Swiss-made timepieces without the premium price. The watches are made with solid stainless steel, premium finishes, genuine leather bands, and Swarovski crystals. Every watch is hand-assembled with care in their Lengnau headquarters in Switzerland. Delbana offers a wide range of affordable luxury watches, from elegant dress watches to robust sports models, all proudly bearing the coveted “Swiss Made” label. Remaining faithful to Della Balda’s vision, Delbana combines Swiss craftsmanship with accessible luxury, producing timepieces that honor precision, quality, and heritage and are budget-friendly for all. Delbana offers an attractive mix of Swiss-made, affordability and great designs, making them a compelling choice without the hefty price tag.

Through a focus on miniaturization and sleek design, it has become synonymous with contemporary horology, achieving nine world records over the past decade, including for the slimmest three-hand watch and automatic chronograph. Now, commemorating Bulgari’s 140th anniversary, the brand introduces the Octo Finissimo Automatique BVL 138 Sketch with an illustrated dial called Esquisse, derived from the Italian word for “sketch.” This concept draws inspiration from the tradition of artists in the Italian Renaissance who kept sketches to refine their craft and share knowledge. Bulgari, with its rich heritage in craftsmanship, embraces this tradition by incorporating hand-drawn sketches into its watchmaking process. The Octo Finissimo Automatique BVL 138 Sketch watch reveals the movement’s back instead of a traditional dial, offering a glimpse into the inner workings of the timepiece, akin to admiring a watch through an open case back. By merging art and technology, Bulgari’s creative studio brilliantly captures the essence of the watch’s design and mechanical intricacy, celebrating both the soul of the timepiece and its technical prowess.",4526142e-5156-5435-8694-c43db1400e5d,21/10/2024 17:09:58

Aptly named the Tangente 38 date – 175 Years Watchmaking Glashütte collection, each of these limited-edition timepieces pays homage to the brand’s 175-year legacy with a unique burst of color, limited to just 175 pieces per version. Embracing the notion that color symbolizes individuality and vitality, NOMOS takes a daring step by transforming its iconic Tangente into a kaleidoscope of expressions. Yet, despite the departure from its traditional look, the essence of the Tangente remains intact, affirming its status as a cornerstone of the Nomos collections. With whimsical German monikers like Ariel, Zirkus, Haifischgrau, and Schlossgrün, each watch in this special edition tells its own distinct story. Breaking the mold, NOMOS makes these exclusive timepieces more accessible by offering them at a price lower than that of the standard model, thus democratizing the joy of mechanical watches. This commitment to inclusivity underscores the brand’s belief that fine watchmaking should be enjoyed by all, fostering a sense of diversity and individuality within the watchmaking world, and ensuring that everyone can partake in this celebration of Glashütte watchmaking. At the heart of the Tangente 38 date beats the hand-wound caliber DUW 4101, made in Glashütte and fitted with NOMOS’s proprietary swing system. Notably, NOMOS’s innovative date mechanism, seamlessly integrated into the movement, ensures a strikingly large date window positioned at the dial’s periphery—an unmistakable hallmark of the brand.",5d40b034-950e-5476-99ee-ce2717794336,21/10/2024 17:09:59

The watch features a quick-set GMT function with push buttons that make adjusting time zones easier and faster. By using the button at 8 o’clock, the GMT hand can be moved backward, while the button at 10 o’clock moves it forward. This, combined with a bi-directional 24-hour bezel and main hands, allows for tracking three time zones simultaneously. For readability in darkness, the watch uses self-powered H₃ gas tubes. This Swiss technology encapsulates H₃ gas in glass micro tubes, releasing light energy without needing an external light or energy source. The watch has 28 tubes on the dial, including the main hour hand, minute hand, and GMT hand, with Arabic numerals at 6, 9, and 12 o’clock. The ceramic bezel’s Super LumiNova coating ensures the time zones can be read in total darkness. The Marine GMT is powered by the chronometer certified automatic caliber BALL RR1203-C, featuring day-date functions. It is water-resistant to 200m/660ft, anti-magnetic to 4,800A/m, and shock-resistant to 5,000Gs. The case is made of titanium, and the bracelet combines stainless steel and titanium parts. The movement is visible through a see-through case back, and the crown screws in for added resistance. This 40mm model comes in several color variations and can also be fitted with a rubber or NATO strap.",e2a73b73-74a1-53ed-8dfa-c568d1ae0128,21/10/2024 17:10:02

The straps are color-matched to the dials, creating an elegant contrast. Some models come with stainless steel bracelets, while others feature stylish black or red leather straps. Each Mini DolceVita watch celebrates elegance and the Italian sweet life, combining heritage with contemporary design for dynamic, spirited women.",cbb3ecc3-84c4-59de-87e0-178dc3edc915,21/10/2024 17:10:03

With a bold 55 mm diameter, this timepiece integrates the Dual Time function and “Oil Immersion” concept, allowing for the monitoring of two different time zones simultaneously. This feature enhances its utility for adventurous travelers. Its design encompasses a profound three-dimensional effect, achieved by filling the case with oil, complemented by dual crowns for versatile time management, and available in variations of 316L stainless steel and DLC-treated black cases. The visual allure is amplified with domed sapphire crystals and a choice of color options for indices and numbers, contributing to its aesthetic sophistication. Functionalities are further enriched with features like a Locking Ring System and a patented quick battery replacement mechanism. Each watch also provides exclusive digital access via a QR code, elevating the ownership experience. Accompanied by elegant strap options in handcrafted black leather and vulcanized rubber, the Capsoil Doppiotempo XXL stands as a testament to enriched functionality intertwined with aesthetic mastery in watchmaking.",5a52a617-acdd-5a78-bfee-ce5dda49e64c,21/10/2024 17:10:04

Trilobe, in particular, is a master craftsman, shaping time with precision. Their approach is a fusion of expertise, creativity, and inspiration, as they delve into the world of lyrical horological complications. Their latest creation, part of the “Les Matinaux” collection, intertwines time with the celestial, adding a mesmerizing moon phase complication for the first time. Within this timepiece, a celestial spectacle unfolds: stars dance across a sapphire crystal while two moons traverse the night sky, synchronized with the X-Centric calibre. The sand-blasted dial, reminiscent of the infinite sky, further enhances the poetic essence, with a gear wheel marking the lunar orbit. This moon phase complication, co-axially linked to the seconds wheel, adds a dynamic element to the starry display. “Être dans la lune,” or “Being in the moon,” encapsulates the enchantment of the present moment, inviting us to appreciate the beauty of the cosmos and to transcend the constraints of earthly time. Trilobe’s vision is to rekindle their relationship with time through dreamlike experiences. In the latest edition, “l’Heure Exquise,” Trilobe retains the classic look of “Les Matinaux,” with slight variations. The hour and minute rings with tilted numerals, gracefully glide across the dial, while a single trilobe indicates the moon. Available in titanium or rose gold, with sand-blasted dials in Dune, Blue, and Secret variations, this timepiece embodies the essence of liberated time and poetic elegance.",964f306d-819f-552f-b5fb-f281556d84fe,21/10/2024 17:10:09

Continuing the rich legacy of OMEGA’s Seamaster collection, renowned for its groundbreaking technology and inventive materials, this year heralds the introduction of the Seamaster Planet Ocean Dark Grey. This timepiece is made from silicon nitride ceramic [Si3N4], marking a pioneering application of this material in the realm of horology by OMEGA. This innovative usage of silicon nitride ceramic revolutionizes the watch’s design, resulting in a timepiece that has remarkable durability and a lightweight feel, optimal for adventurous pursuits. Its use of the 45.5 mm case, patented NAIAD LOCK caseback, and bezel ring enhances the watch’s robustness and overall appeal. OMEGA has adeptly paired the dark grey ceramic with Grade 5 titanium, a material esteemed in aerospace sectors, to make the bezel and strap folding clasp. This sophisticated juxtaposition of materials underscores the watch’s formidable resilience without compromising on its weight. The intricately sand-blasted dial, adorned with anthracite hands and indexes, further amplifies its rugged elegance. In synergy with its robust design, the watch features an automatic movement with a distinctively dark allure. The OMEGA Co-Axial Master Chronometer Calibre 8906 emanates a unique lightness and includes a GMT function, ensuring unmatched precision and functionality. Protected by a sapphire crystal with a dual-sided anti-reflective treatment, this timepiece asserts its dominance with a water resistance up to 600 meters, a testament to the Seamaster.",917b611f-046e-5b6f-918a-79ac0e5ad632,21/10/2024 17:10:11

It features a 24-hour inner-ring and highly readable indexes, making the “Field” in Jungle Field an apt description. In this more creative interpretation of GG-W-113, the dial is popcorn-textured black dial and features applied patina indexes. Originally, the GG-W-113 specification mandated that watches be “parkerized” to reduce shine; a similar effect has been achieved here with a thorough sandblasting of the entire case and case back. The 34mm size of the Jungle Field watch is a nod to the original 1960s US Military watches, which also had a similar standard diameter. The overall case thickness is less than 10mm to further minimize the watch’s presence on the wrist. The Jungle Field is powered by a Swiss-Made Ronda 763 Quartz movement to ensure reliable and rugged timekeeping while maintaining a slim case profile. This is complemented by 5ATM (50M/163ft) water resistance and a sapphire-coated mineral crystal. Praesidus Watch Co. is a watchmaking brand inspired by World War II’s robust and functional military timepieces. Founded in the 21st century by watch enthusiasts and history buffs, Praesidus combines vintage designs with modern engineering. The name “Praesidus,” meaning “guardian” in Latin, reflects the brand’s commitment to reliability and precision. Their mission is to create watches that honor the past while meeting modern needs, offering both functionality and style. Praesidus watches use high-quality materials like stainless steel, sapphire crystal, and Swiss or Japanese movements. The designs often feature large, easy-to-read dials and luminous hands reminiscent of vintage military watches. Depending on the destination, the estimated delivery time for Praesidus watches ranges from 5 to 14 business days.

With its elegant textured finish, the dial represents a significant technical achievement, accentuating the watch’s sophistication. It boldly departs from traditional symmetry by consisting of four components, three constantly in motion. These include the largest ring for tracking hours, a minutes wheel that discreetly appears through an opening, and a seconds wheel with a center adorned with a “”Clous de Paris”” pattern. This interplay between minutes and seconds offers a glimpse into the infinite and the relentless progression of time, all enclosed within a meticulously finished inner bezel. In terms of architecture and movement, Trilobe not only redefines our perception of time but also reimagines space with a bold architectural statement. “”Nuit Fantastique”” represents a dive into the world of deconstructivism, aptly referred to as “”New Modern Architecture.”” This architectural style encourages free thought, introducing fresh geometries, unconventional forms, and an undeniable sense of dynamism. It challenges traditional notions of form and function, advocating for a departure from established design norms. At the core of Nuit Fantastique Grained Silver, in rose gold, lies the X-Centric calibre, an exclusive automatic movement featuring a micro-rotor meticulously crafted solely for Trilobe, reflecting the brand’s distinct identity.",cffc25ae-8bff-52a8-9c3a-7b504169458c,21/10/2024 17:10:12

Made from a material born in the cosmos, each dial has a singular design, nestled securely within a featherweight 40mm titanium casing. The Roadmaster Marine GMT is the first BALL model to feature a dial of the Gibeon meteorite, renowned as one of the most illustrious meteorites worldwide. Originating from a colossal asteroid’s detonation and journeying through space, this meteorite arrived on Earth approximately 600 million years ago. Its crystalline formations, known as Widmanstätten patterns, evolved over eons as its iron and nickel alloys gradually cooled, defying replication on Earth. The Roadmaster Marine GMT now features enhanced brightness, with elongated micro gas tubes on the GMT and seconds hands. These groundbreaking tubes, self-sustaining in their luminosity, feature on the meteorite dial at each hour marker and on both hands, facilitating swift time readings even in the darkest environs. Teamed with the Super-LumiNova-coated ceramic bezel, three time zones are effortlessly discernible in pitch darkness. It is simple to use the patented quick-set buttons to adjust the GMT hand, bypassing the need to manipulate the main crown. The button at 8 o’clock regresses the GMT hand, while its counterpart at 10 o’clock propels it forward. While traveling, the GMT hand aligns with local time alongside the dial’s edge markings, while the primary hour hand denotes home time. Coupled with the bidirectional bezel, the quick-set GMT hand showcases the time in a third geographical zone of your choosing. This entire movement has garnered COSC certification for its unparalleled precision.",62e90206-b3e8-5146-9a7b-0531964f7f05,21/10/2024 17:10:14

Based on the original USN BUSHIPS design, this rugged dive watch features an oversized crown and solid case. During World War II, it was the only way Underwater Demolition Teams could ensure their watches remained water-resistant during long dives. At first glance, the A-5 UDT may seem simple, but it’s much more. The deeply embossed indexes and minute track stand out from the matte black dial, enhancing legibility. The brand and the collection name are also embossed and visible under certain conditions without distracting from critical timekeeping. Swiss Super-Luminova ensures legibility for low-light and deep-underwater operations. Inspired by WW2 USN BUSHIPS designs, the A-5 is “field-tested.” Its oversized crown cap, welded directly onto the case, speaks to its operational origins. The original design has been enhanced to achieve 20ATM (660ft) water resistance with a double-domed sapphire crystal. To ensure precision and reliability, the A-5 UDT features a Swiss Automatic P024 movement from SOPROD, known for its accuracy and 41-hour power reserve. Anti-magnetic and shockproof, it can withstand harsh conditions, fulfilling its mission as a durable dive watch. Praesidus Watch Co. is a watchmaking brand inspired by World War II’s robust and functional military timepieces. Founded in the 21st century by watch enthusiasts and history buffs, Praesidus combines vintage designs with modern engineering. The name “Praesidus,” meaning “guardian” in Latin, reflects the brand’s commitment to reliability and precision. Their mission is to create watches that honor the past while meeting modern needs, offering both functionality and style. Praesidus watches use high-quality materials like stainless steel, sapphire crystal, and Swiss or Japanese movements. The designs often feature large, easy-to-read dials and luminous hands reminiscent of vintage military watches. Depending on the destination, the estimated delivery time for Praesidus watches ranges from 5 to 14 business days. Please be aware that customs procedures may affect these timeframes, and the estimated delivery period does not include the time needed for customs clearance. Outside of the United States, shipments may be subject to import duties once they reach your country. We do not control or assume responsibility for these additional charges; customers are responsible for customs clearance fees.

This timepiece is engineered to excel in the most extreme conditions, where ice, water, and mist pose formidable challenges. At its core lies a 42.5mm angular titanium case, ensuring both strength and resistance to corrosion, crucial for prolonged exposure to salty seawater. Designed for professional saturation diving, it features a helium escape valve and a ceramic unidirectional rotating bezel with Super-LumiNova for enhanced visibility in low-light underwater environments. True to its lineage, the DEFY Extreme Diver maintains a water resistance of 600 meters (60 ATM), meeting ISO 6425 standards for professional diver watches. Its dial with a geometric pattern of engraved stars, offers exceptional legibility with oversized hands and hour markers coated in multiple grades of Super-LumiNova. Powering the timepiece is the El Primero 3620-SC automatic high-frequency caliber, boasting a 60-hour power reserve and a paramagnetic escapement with silicon components, visible through a sapphire display back—an unusual feature in diver’s watches. Completing its robust design is a titanium three-link bracelet and two additional straps, including one made from recycled fishing nets as part of ZENITH’s sustainability initiative, HORIZ-ON. This strap is specially designed for wear over a wetsuit, emphasizing the watch’s versatility and commitment to environmental responsibility.",9cc786e0-833a-516a-b4d1-dcd5c8c51cd3,21/10/2024 17:10:18

The timepiece reflects the hedonistic charm of the era, offering three dial finishes: sunray brushed black, vertical brushed champagne, and sunray brushed blue. The watch features generously proportioned hour and minute hands, bold Arabic-style indices, and Super-LumiNova® for enhanced visibility in dim light. The small seconds display is positioned at 6 o’clock. Available in a 38.5mm stainless steel case, the watch offers options for a color-coordinated leather strap or a 3-row stainless steel bracelet. The polished case is designed with a recessed crown and symmetrical recess adjacent to 9 o’clock. The caseback is engraved with the iconic entrance of the Sans Souci. The Robusto Sans Souci is powered by the CYS 5159 automatic calibre, based on the SW261 movement. Combining Swiss watchmaking expertise with Cuban cultural heritage, the Robusto Sans Souci embodies the spirit of Cuervo y Sobrinos “Born in Havana. Crafted in Switzerland.” Cuervo y Sobrinos has a rich history dating back to 1862 when Spanish immigrant Ramón Fernández Cuervo opened a jewelry and watch repair shop in Havana, Cuba. In 1882, the business expanded with the incorporation of Cuervo’s nephews, officially becoming Cuervo y Sobrinos. The company thrived during Cuba’s golden age in the 1950s, with its prestigious boutique in Havana frequented by distinguished figures like Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, and Ernest Hemingway. Today, Cuervo y Sobrinos is located in Switzerland, but despite this, it has remained true to its Latin roots, drawing inspiration from its Cuban heritage for its watch designs and collections. Cuervo y Sobrinos has withstood the test of time, blending Swiss watchmaking expertise with Cuban flair, earning them a loyal following among watch enthusiasts.

This timepiece from the collection boasts a sleek, glossy black dial, intentionally free of numerals and other elements, highlighting the exquisite black laqué piano finish and the overall allure of the watch. The dial is meticulously crafted with 20 layers of translucent lacquer and five layers of colored lacquer, creating a striking look that complements the polished case beautifully. One of the standout features of the Curvex CX Piano is its pear-shaped hands, which gracefully adorn the black laqué piano dial. This design choice not only adds to the watch’s aesthetic appeal but also ensures clear visibility of the time. The Curvex CX Piano is not just about its visual appeal; comfort is also a key consideration. The black satin strap is designed for ultimate wrist comfort while also enhancing the watch’s sophisticated look with its black laqué piano finish. The design of the Curvex CX Piano includes a perfectly curved case with unique contours, offering excellent dial visibility and minimizing material on the sides. The internal bezel, distinct from the case and set beneath the sapphire glass, allows for stunning two-tone effects. The Curvex CX collection has grown to include new sizes of 30 and 33 millimeters, with case options of yellow gold, rose gold, stainless steel, or black steel.

The watch features a quick-set GMT function with push buttons that make adjusting time zones easier and faster. By using the button at 8 o’clock, the GMT hand can be moved backward, while the button at 10 o’clock moves it forward. This, combined with a bi-directional 24-hour bezel and main hands, allows for tracking three time zones simultaneously. For readability in darkness, the watch uses self-powered H₃ gas tubes. This Swiss technology encapsulates H₃ gas in glass micro tubes, releasing light energy without needing an external light or energy source. The watch has 28 tubes on the dial, including the main hour hand, minute hand, and GMT hand, with Arabic numerals at 6, 9, and 12 o’clock. The ceramic bezel’s Super LumiNova coating ensures the time zones can be read in total darkness. The Marine GMT is powered by the chronometer certified automatic caliber BALL RR1203-C, featuring day-date functions. It is water-resistant to 200m/660ft, anti-magnetic to 4,800A/m, and shock-resistant to 5,000Gs. The case is made of titanium, and the bracelet combines stainless steel and titanium parts. The movement is visible through a see-through case back, and the crown screws in for added resistance. This 40mm model comes in several color variations and can also be fitted with a rubber or NATO strap.",1a8783d7-2ac2-5bf7-8da6-460ca45abede,21/10/2024 17:10:20

Its dial with a geometric pattern of engraved stars, offers exceptional legibility with oversized hands and hour markers coated in multiple grades of Super-LumiNova. Powering the timepiece is the El Primero 3620-SC automatic high-frequency caliber, boasting a 60-hour power reserve and a paramagnetic escapement with silicon components, visible through a sapphire display back—an unusual feature in diver’s watches. Completing its robust design is a titanium three-link bracelet and two additional straps, including one made from recycled fishing nets as part of ZENITH’s sustainability initiative, HORIZ-ON. This strap is specially designed for wear over a wetsuit, emphasizing the watch’s versatility and commitment to environmental responsibility.",93bdd773-a425-5ebd-8ec5-af763befbed6,21/10/2024 17:10:21

This watch features a deep brown dial and patina indexes and hands, designed to mimic a rare aging process. Over the years, exposure to sun and humidity causes black dial paint to transform into a dark brown. This unique “tropicalization” effect on the DD-45 creates a distinct and vintage look, reminiscent of some rare Dirty Dozen watches seen today, 80 years after their initial production. The DD-45 is not just a visual tribute but also a modern one to the original Dirty Dozen watches, which were designed for the British War Office to standardize high-performance field watches for the British Army. The DD-45 surpasses the original specifications, bringing the design into the 21st century. Originally intended to be “Waterproof,” the DD-45 now has 10ATM water resistance and a screw-down crown, ensuring durability and safety in wet conditions. Additionally, the double-domed sapphire crystal provides best-in-class scratch resistance. Respecting the historical origins of the original Dirty Dozen watches, all twelve of which were produced in Switzerland, the DD-45 is powered by the Swiss-made Landeron L24 movement. This movement features 28,800 beats per hour (BPH) and 25 jewels, ensuring a smooth second-hand movement and high precision, ready for use in any condition. Praesidus Watch Co. is a watchmaking brand inspired by World War II’s robust and functional military timepieces. Founded in the 21st century by watch enthusiasts and history buffs, Praesidus combines vintage designs with modern engineering. The name “Praesidus,” meaning “guardian” in Latin, reflects the brand’s commitment to reliability and precision. Their mission is to create watches that honor the past while meeting modern needs, offering both functionality and style. Praesidus watches use high-quality materials like stainless steel, sapphire crystal, and Swiss or Japanese movements. The designs often feature large, easy-to-read dials and luminous hands reminiscent of vintage military watches. Depending on the destination, the estimated delivery time for Praesidus watches ranges from 5 to 14 business days. Please be aware that customs procedures may affect these timeframes, and the estimated delivery period does not include the time needed for customs clearance. Outside of the United States, shipments may be subject to import duties once they reach your country. We do not control or assume responsibility for these additional charges; customers are responsible for customs clearance fees. Customs policies differ widely from country to country, and on rare occasions, customs agents may delay package deliveries. For detailed information, please contact your local customs office.

This effect is further enhanced by the sunray-brushed finish on the metallic base of the dial, creating a dynamic and ever-changing appearance.

The watch features a quick-set GMT function with push buttons that make adjusting time zones easier and faster. By using the button at 8 o’clock, the GMT hand can be moved backward, while the button at 10 o’clock moves it forward. This, combined with a bi-directional 24-hour bezel and main hands, allows for tracking three time zones simultaneously. For readability in darkness, the watch uses self-powered H₃ gas tubes. This Swiss technology encapsulates H₃ gas in glass micro tubes, releasing light energy without needing an external light or energy source. The watch has 28 tubes on the dial, including the main hour hand, minute hand, and GMT hand, with Arabic numerals at 6, 9, and 12 o’clock. The ceramic bezel’s Super LumiNova coating ensures the time zones can be read in total darkness. The Marine GMT is powered by the chronometer certified automatic caliber BALL RR1203-C, featuring day-date functions. It is water-resistant to 200m/660ft, anti-magnetic to 4,800A/m, and shock-resistant to 5,000Gs. The case is made of titanium, and the bracelet combines stainless steel and titanium parts. The movement is visible through a see-through case back, and the crown screws in for added resistance. This 40mm model comes in several color variations and can also be fitted with a rubber or NATO strap.",4200acba-1136-5f8c-8036-8628094d53e7,21/10/2024 17:10:25

Each model is water-resistant up to 100 meters, blending functionality with style. At the core of the watch is the STP6-15 movement, a testament to precision and performance. Equipped with 26 jewels and operating at a 4Hz frequency, it ensures a smooth seconds hand sweep and boasts a 44-hour power reserve with automatic winding. Rigorous testing in five different positions guarantees the movement’s accuracy, maintaining a performance range of -0/+15 seconds per day.

Their latest venture, the Free-D, marks another avant-garde leap forward. The Free-D distinguishes itself through the use of sustainable and innovative materials, specifically PA11 & PA12, chosen for their lightness, durability, and flexibility. This polyamide, proven in the medical, aerospace, and racing sectors, aligns with SEVENFRIDAY’s ethos of sustainability and exploration of novel construction methods. Design-wise, the Free-D takes inspiration from nature, particularly evoking insect-like forms, with the protective “shell” encasing the dial and movement. The material’s organic nature further accentuates the futuristic aesthetic, allowing for unprecedented design freedom unattainable with traditional materials. Central to the Free-D is its fusion of innovation, design, and sustainability, encapsulated by its unconventional production process and material choice. Available in white, turquoise, and pink, and each color is limited to 30 pieces. SevenFriday is a Swiss watch brand that burst onto the scene in 2012, shaking up the traditional watch world with its bold, edgy designs. Founded by Daniel Niederer and Arnaud Duval, the brand didn’t aim to blend in with the classic Swiss luxury watchmakers; instead, it set out to do something completely different. Forget sleek, minimalist dials and delicate hands—SevenFriday watches are all about industrial vibes, oversized cases, and cool, layered dials that show off their inner workings. Inspired by everything from machinery to architecture, SevenFriday watches have a distinct look that’s impossible to miss. They play with materials like stainless steel, wood, and leather, giving each watch a unique and tactile feel. And while the brand comes out of Switzerland, its pricing is surprisingly approachable, making it a favorite for people who want something stylish and distinctive without breaking the bank.",4c7a68ec-8e66-5494-b5e0-09377bb5f73e,21/10/2024 17:10:27

These watches exemplify the elegance of the Art Deco era, seamlessly blending graceful curves with sharp, clean lines. The dial of the Espléndidos Vitola features a leaf pattern reminiscent of tobacco leaves, paying homage to Cuba’s rich cigar-making heritage. Additionally, the hour markers are meticulously crafted to resemble the iconic shape of Cuban cigars. Cuervo y Sobrinos has a rich history dating back to 1862 when Spanish immigrant Ramón Fernández Cuervo opened a jewelry and watch repair shop in Havana, Cuba. In 1882, the business expanded with the incorporation of Cuervo’s nephews, officially becoming Cuervo y Sobrinos. The company thrived during Cuba’s golden age in the 1950s, with its prestigious boutique in Havana frequented by distinguished figures like Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, and Ernest Hemingway. Today, Cuervo y Sobrinos is located in Switzerland, but despite this, it has remained true to its Latin roots, drawing inspiration from its Cuban heritage for its watch designs and collections. Cuervo y Sobrinos has withstood the test of time, blending Swiss watchmaking expertise with Cuban flair, earning them a loyal following among watch enthusiasts.

The Raketa Polar watch draws inspiration from the iconic 1970 Raketa model, custom-crafted for Soviet polar explorers enduring the harshest Antarctic conditions. Its distinctive feature is the dial divided into 24 hours, ensuring precise timekeeping even beyond the polar circle, where the line between day and night blurs. This updated model elevates its capabilities with enhanced durability, featuring scratch-resistant sapphire glass that safeguards the dial. Thanks to the luminous paint applied to both hands and markers, it ensures impeccable time readability in the dark polar winters. Additionally, the watch boasts impressive pressure resistance, capable of withstanding up to 20 ATM, equivalent to enduring pressures found 200 meters underwater. Engineered by Russian experts at the Raketa Watch Factory, this model boasts an automatic movement crafted entirely in Saint Petersburg. The movement’s decor mirrors the captivating polar lights in the northern sky. Moreover, the Raketa “Polar” 0242 watch is officially certified by the Russian Federal Agency for Technical Regulation & Metrology, meeting stringent standards for survival in the unforgiving polar environment. Each watch comes with its own individual certificate, attesting to its quality and endurance. Explore the legacy of polar exploration with this exceptional timepiece.",c7b8857a-f0f4-5975-81bd-96ad2d2bd86a,21/10/2024 17:10:29

Discovery Global Consumer Products, presents an innovative collection inspired by the iconic universe of “Game of Thrones” and its successor series, “House of the Dragon.” Renowned for pushing the boundaries of design, Kross Studio introduces a series of exclusive collector sets, each paying homage to a dragon from the fantasy saga. Each set comprises a central floating tourbillon watch and a dragon egg sculpture, embodying the essence of Targaryen royalty and the mystique of dragons. At the heart of these collector sets lies the central tourbillon, a masterpiece of horology designed by Kross Studio Founder Marco Tedeschi. The tourbillon reflects the distinct aesthetic codes of House Targaryen, from its opulent case to its intricate movement. The floating tourbillon’s suspension beneath a sapphire crystal dome offers a captivating view of the watch’s inner workings, reminiscent of a dragon gliding through the heavens. The Games of Thrones—House of Dragons Collector Set integrates elements from the fantasy series, including a Damasteel® dial reminiscent of Valyrian steel and a titanium case engraved with intricate dragon scales. Each of the 10 collector sets is dedicated to a specific dragon, and the dragon’s name is engraved on the case back, adding a personalized touch to each piece. Each set comes with a unique dragon egg sculpture made by the French workshop Leblon Delienne. Each resin egg, airbrushed to achieve a unique finish, serves as a nest for the watch and draws inspiration from the appearance of its corresponding dragon. The attention to detail extends to the egg’s design, featuring elements inspired by Dragonstone Castle, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen.
